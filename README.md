### Hello, I'm Bryan Thompson... Welcome to my GitHub!


I love breaking down severely complex problems to easier to solve pieces. I spend my free time playing games, where I regularly break everything down to a science to solve my issues. I worked in customer service and sales for a lifetime, which means I have a lifetime of helping people meet their needs. 

I started my journey with IT Management, including physical server management and Azure cloud computing, but found I enjoyed the times I dove into code more. I self studied for a decent bit to get a good grasp of everything before jumping into a bootcamp to really drive things home.

I have proven that I can not only learn quickly, but I can change tracks and learn an entirely different language and framework at a quick pace as well.
